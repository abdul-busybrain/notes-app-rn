## üìñ What I've Learned

### Introduction to React Native

Learn how React Native enables building native mobile applications for iOS and Android using a single JavaScript codebase. Understand the key differences between React Native and traditional web development.

### Project Setup and Configuration

Master the process of setting up a React Native project with Expo, including initializing the project, understanding the file structure, and configuring necessary dependencies.

### Building Core Functionality

Develop the essential features of a notes app:

- Creating new notes
- Viewing a list of existing notes
- Updating note content
- Deleting unwanted notes

### Backend Integration

Implement a connection to Appwrite to store and retrieve data, enabling persistence across app sessions and devices. Learn how to structure API calls for efficient data management.

### User Authentication

Implement secure user signup and login functionality to protect user data and provide personalized experiences. Learn best practices for handling user credentials and maintaining session state.

### Styling and UI/UX Design

Apply styling techniques specific to React Native to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface that follows mobile design principles and enhances user experience.

### Deployment Preparation

Understand the process of building and publishing your application to app stores, including configuration requirements and submission guidelines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Development

### Fresh Project Setup

When you're ready to start from scratch:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### File-Based Routing

This project leverages Expo's file-based routing system. Navigation is handled automatically based on the file structure in the `app` directory.
